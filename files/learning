Conditional Rendering: Using if, &&, and ternary operators.
Intermediate Level: Beyond Basics

4. React Hooks
useEffect: Side effects like fetching data, timers, subscriptions.
useRef: Managing references to DOM elements and maintaining values.
useContext: Simplifying prop drilling by managing global state.
Custom Hooks: Reusable logic across components.

5. Routing
Using React Router:
BrowserRouter and Routes
Link vs NavLink
Nested Routes
Dynamic Routes (useParams)
Programmatic Navigation (useNavigate)

6. State Management
Context API for global state.
Third-party libraries: Redux Toolkit or Zustand.
Differences between local, global, and derived states.

7. Form Handling
Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components.
Libraries: Formik and React Hook Form.
Validations with Yup or Zod.

8. API Integration
Fetching Data: fetch or Axios.
Managing async operations: Loading states and error handling.
Querying APIs with React Query.

9. CSS in React
CSS Modules
Styled Components
Tailwind CSS
Emotion
